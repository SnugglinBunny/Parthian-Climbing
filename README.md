# Parthian-Climbing

DISCONTINUED - Parthian removed the counter from their website.

The script is designed to run all day and uses https://parthianclimbing.com/reading/ to get the current amount of people at the climbing gym every hour. This data is then pushed into a google sheet where further analysis is done so that we can determine the best times and days to go.
